New features coming on PX2 with MXCuBE Qt4
==========================================
1. Grid scans (specification and result display including graphical overlays in the video stream)

2. X-ray centring (both as a separate experimental method and signle click button launcher with reasonable defaults)

3. Arbitrary orietations optical sample alignment with modeling of refractive and geometrical properties of sample environment

4. Optical grids
   -- beyond single view camera field of view limitation
   -- automatic panorama generation using image stitching
   -- useful especially for large supports e.g. chips or plates

5. Continuous energy scans
   -- Increasing accuracy of the edge determination by sub eV sampling
   -- Execting scans over the shoulder undulator peaks instead of main peak to even out the flux over the scan range to help with normalization

6. Extensive diagnostic information associating experimental actuators and intensity monitors for every image or spectrum recorded

7. Inverse beam scans with Eiger generate HDF5 datasets as canonical sweeps (not as separte wedges)

8. Interleaved MAD experiment method

9. Possibility to specify any kind of interleaving for any omega scan based method (including inverse beam and any interleaved experiment)

10. Introducing menu for automated switching between focussing modes. Available modes:
    * Mode 1   - unfocussed beam, beam size determined by aperture size or experimental slits settings
    * Mode 2   - KB focussing using VFM and HFM. Beam size of 5x10 um
    * Mode 3   - KB + HPM focussing. Beam size of 3x5 um
    * Mode 1.2 - Vertical focussing usign VFM. Horizontal beam size determined by aperture or experimental slits, vertical size 5 um
    * Mode 1.5 - Horizontal focussing using HFM. Vertical beam size determined by aperture or experimental slits, horizotal size 10 um
    * Mode 2.5 - Horizontal focussing using HFM and HPM. Vertical beam size determined by aperture or experimental slits, horizotal size 3 um

11. Possibility to specify 4M ROI detector mode for any experiment

12. X-ray fluorescence spectrum available as a distinct experiment from the experiments tab.

13. Introducing absorption tomography experiment as a distinct experimental method.

14. Serial crystallography experimental method

15. Diffraction based tomography experiment as a distinct experimental method.

16. OAV polarizer control integrated in the camera menu

17. More intelligent sample queue managment 
    -- possibility to reshufle order of pucks in the queue 
    -- possibility to extend the size of the queue beyond the maximum number of pucks in the dewar 
    -- possibility to mix manually and robotcally mounted samples in the queue
    -- optical sample recognition of dewar content incorporated

18. Accurate flux and beam size information placed on dominantly
    -- flux estimation accurate to within 5%
    
19. Session log and persistence 
    -- possibility to restart and come back to a session at any point without losing history and the results. 
    -- possibility to manage multi-day (discontinuous) experiments within a single MXCuBE session
    -- extensive user action log (click stream recording)
    -- video stream recording (OAV + hutch security cameras)

20. Secure data management
    -- as soon as data leave detector they are associated with id of the user performing the experiment and enforce access rules valid for the user (data not readable or modifiable by anyone else by default)
    -- data synchronized to long term storage and publish area of the ruche immediately.
    
21. Automated data analysis for all standard experimentas implemented
    -- Omega scans, including MAD, inverse beam and interleaved experiments are automatically processed using xdsme, autoPROC and xia2 (with DIALS)
    -- Grid scans, automatically processed using dials.find_spots, phenix.signal_strength and DOZOR and overlays generated for all metrics available
    -- X-ray centring automatically analysed using dials.find_spots, phenix.signal_strength and DOZOR
    -- Energy scans analyzed automatically using Chooch and also custom fitting procedure
    -- X-ray fluorescence spectra analyzed automatically -- automated element search

22. Introducing Expert tab
    Alignment of significant part of beamline components accessible. 
    All alignments are available both as single push buttons procedures (employing reasonable defaults) and as fully fledged experiments with all of the scan and analysis parameters modifiable. 
    All alignment methods may be executed based on both continuous and stepped (slower and less accurate).
    -- automated alignment of all slit pairs of the beamline using all relevant intensity monitors including calibrated diode at the sample position
        - slits1 -- cooled slit pair before monochromator
        - slits2 -- after monochromator
        - slits3 after HPM but before KB mirrors
        - slits5 after KB
        - slits6 scatterless experimental slits 22mm before sample position
    -- automated alignment of fast shutter
    -- monochromator calibration using Fe filter 
    -- monochromator pusher calibration
    -- aperture alignment
    -- capilary alignment
    
    Additional tools available from the tab are
    -- beamcenter calibration experiment
       - establishing dependence of beam center on detector distance, photon energy and detector translation
       - experiment can be made both in direct beam (using extremely low transmission) and using powder standard (AgBe, LaB6, Si ...)
    --  Automated determination of beam flux and beam size at the sample
